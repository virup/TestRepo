/*
Package twilio provides server side authentication utilities for applications to integrate with Twilio service.

Access Tokens are short-lived tokens that can be used to authenticate Twilio Client SDKs like
Video and IP Messaging. See detail in https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/access-tokens.

Capability Tokens are a secure way of setting up your device to access various features of Twilio,
allowing you to add Twilio capabilities to web and mobile applications without exposing your
AuthToken in any client-side environment. See detail in https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/client/capability-tokens.
